# Regression Task Submission

This folder contains my work for the **Regression Task** (predicting continuous numerical variables) as part of the Machine Learning module.

## Files
- `Assessment Regression Report.docx`: Full report comparing models
- `Regression Heatmap Assignment.ipynb`: Data visualization (scatter matrix/heatmaps)
- `Multivariate Regression Assignment.ipynb`: Algorithm 1 - Multivariate Linear Regression
- `Decision Tree Regressor Assignment.ipynb`: Algorithm 2 - Decision Tree Regressor
- `Neural Network Regression Assignment.ipynb`: Neural Network implementation
- `Regression Data Assignment.ipynb`: Data preprocessing/analysis

## Key Features
- Compared RÂ² scores and MSE metrics across models
- Visualized feature correlations
- Implemented neural network with TensorFlow/Keras
- Detailed analysis of model performance in report
- Suggested improvements (feature engineering, hyperparameter tuning)
