# Classification Task Submission

This folder contains my work for the **Classification Task** (predicting class labels) as part of the Machine Learning module, using the Wisconsin Breast Cancer dataset.

## Files
- `Assessment Classification Report.docx`: Full report comparing models
- `Classification Heatmap Scatterplot Matrix Assignment.ipynb`: Data visualization
- `Random Forest Classification Assignment.ipynb`: Algorithm 1 - Random Forest
- `Support Vector Machines Assignment.ipynb`: Algorithm 2 - SVM 
- `Neural Network Classification Assignment.ipynb`: Neural Network implementation 
- `breast_cancer.csv`: Dataset used

## Key Features
- Achieved >95% accuracy across all models
- Implemented data normalization and one-hot encoding
- Compared precision/recall/F1 scores
- Visualized feature importance
- Detailed neural network architecture discussion in report
- Suggested improvements (data augmentation, dropout layers)
